                    <h2>About Museum</h2>
                    <p>The building design was decided by an architectural competition announced on <span> 7 January 2002. The organisers received 1,557 entries from 82 countries</span>, making it the second largest architectural competition in history. In the second stage of the competition, 20 entries submitted additional information on their designs. Judging was complete by <span>2 June 2003</span>. The competition was won by architects Róisín Heneghan and Shi-Fu Peng, and their company Heneghan Peng Architects of Ireland; the awarded prize was <span>US$250,000</span>.The building was designed by Heneghan Peng Architects, Buro Happold, and Arup. The landscape and site masterplan was designed by West 8; the exhibition masterplan, exhibition design, and museology was led by Atelier Brückner. <br> <br> <span>On 2 February 2010</span>, Hill International announced that Egypt's Ministry of Culture had signed a contract with a joint venture of Hill and <span>EHAF</span> Consulting Engineers to provide project management services during the design and construction of the Grand Egyptian Museum. <br> <br>
                        Exterior under construction <span>in 2019</span>
                        The building is shaped like a chamfered triangle in plan. <span>It sits on a site 2 kilometres (1.2 miles)</span> northwest of the pyramids, near a motorway interchange. The building's north and south walls line up directly with the Great Pyramid of Khufu and the Pyramid of Menkaure. The front of the museum includes a large plaza filled with date palms and a façade made of translucent alabaster stone. Inside the main entrance is a large atrium, where large statues will be exhibited. <br> <br>
                        The project is estimated to cost <span>US$550 million</span>, of which <span>US$300 million</span> will be financed from Japanese loans. The remaining costs are financed by the Supreme Council of Antiquities, other donations, and international funds. <br> <br>
                        The new museum is designed to include newer technologies, <span>such as virtual reality</span>. <span>The museum will also be an international center of communication between museums</span>, to promote direct contact with other local and international museums. The Grand Egyptian Museum will include a children's museum, conference center, training center, and workshops designed similarly to the old Pharaonic places.
